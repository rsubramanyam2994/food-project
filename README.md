# Brainstorming later advancements
- Making it incredibly easy to add a recipe with real simple instructions. Things like if one mentions a dish, cross search to identify possible ingredients and prompt the same
- Make this a framework that somebody can extend by just adding files in correct formats. If you know macros and micros of food items, you can add a recipe. Provide sources on where you can typically find these
- Scrape hebbars and create recipe files with standardised ingredient ids.

# TODO
- Add notes from notion on reason for this project
- Add micro template for fat
